WWG-Welcome
===========

What happens in the #general of the WWG Slack you wonder? We welcome people. With some hand-googled gopher. Now I automated that task, `/welcome` with the name as seed for the gopher for perfect results every time!

## Inspiration?

I'm a big fan of [Gopherize.me](https://gopherize.me), with the lates [blog post](https://medium.com/@matryer/the-secret-api-behind-gopherize-me-9202654578dc) I read explaining their API the idea came up to turn it into a slackbot!

## What does this script look like?
